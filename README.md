Hello Everyone👋🏼

In this project I took the Dodge game where you have to avoid enemies and not let them touch you , 
and added a twist to it with my favorite childhood series: "Pokemon".

🎮 In addition to evasion there are also other options:
* Option to choose your character nd your enemy.
* You can attack the enemy and score points.
* Attacks are adjusted according to your chosen character.
